            <p>Alkaline Water and it's benefits is one of the newer trends to have made its way into the already overcrowded 
				wellness and healthy eating world. Drinking alkaline water, it is said, offers more health benefits than one. 
				it helps slow down the ageing process, regulate pH levels of the body and prevent various chronic diseases. 
				Alkaline water refers to neutralising acid levels in the body, which normal water cannot do. This controversial 
				health practice has been argued over its use by many health experts. let's find out what alkaline water is all 
				about and if it's worth the hype.</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
			<p>Ionized water has three very important differences from tap or bottled water: <br> 
				1) pH: It provides pH-buffers that are essentials; these buffers allow the body cells to get rid of Acidic waste 
				and eliminate toxins from the body.It balances the pH level in the human body <br>
				2) Antioxidants: It contains natural, healing, antioxidants (including powerful molecular hydrogen) to fight 
				free-radicals and even reverse its damage, and <br>
				3) Micro-Clustered water : Alkaline water ionizer machines break the water down from larger clusters of water 
				molecules to smaller ones. By creating micro-clusters, a water ionizer creates water that is more easily able 
				to pass through pores, tissues and cell membranes. therefore alkaline ionized water will hydrate the body and 
				cells better and faster</p>

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
			<p>We all know fish will die if they're put in a tank that doesn't have the right pH balance. Think of our cells as 
				like those fish. They will die if not constantly bathed in the right pH water. Most people are not aware just 
				how important pH-balance is to our internal body-health. Alkaline pH helps the body to get rid of toxins. Without 
				alkaline buffers the toxins get trapped in fat cells, joints and elsewhere in the body.Keeping pH-balanced helps us 
				to cleanse the toxins out of the body, making it so much healthier. Losing fat is also improved by balancing the 
				body's pH. Dr. robert o. young stated that: "our body is only as healthy as the water it's bathed in." "it's acids 
				that make us fat.“ He said that,"if someone were to ask me, 'what is the one thing i can do to have better health?', 
				then the answer would be simple: start drinking alkaline, ionized water.”Obviously people don't die with the wrong 
				pH drinking-water, at least not right away. But, the way we see our cells' reaction to the wrong water is through 
				sickness, allergies, heart disease, arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, failing organs, and so on. An alkaline water 
				ionizer machine can help to turn all of that around by giving you a constant supply of pH-buffers all day long.
				A water ionizer gives you better, healthier, more hydrating water than anything else

				Another thing that acidic toxins do is settle into joints. They do this by solidifying into uric acid crystals, 
				causing a kind of arthritis. The body has evolved this form of arthritis as a protective mechanism. Without removing 
				the acidic toxins our bodies would die, so arthritis is a solution in that sense.

          <div class="text-component">
			<p>A water ionizer has the ability to transform ordinary water into antioxidant water, which is rich in Molecular 
				Hydrogen ( 2 Hydrogen atoms formed into a molecule). Molecular hydrogen is the simplest and most powerful antioxidant

				Molecular hydrogen has been found to be the most powerful and safe antioxidant there is for fighting free-radicals.
				Alkaline water can be created in other ways, but when it is, it doesn't have molecular hydrogen antioxidants. Watch

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>
				Oxidation: Oxidation is what's happening to the apple in this picture or to iron when it rusts. ORP means 
				"oxidation reduction potential", which can be measured with a meter. <br> Oxidation happens inside our bodies all the 
				time and contributes to diseases. Oxidation is a chemical reaction. Active Oxygen [O2+] or other free-radicals 
				circulate the body, stealing electrons & damaging the cells. A free radical is an unbalanced molecule with an 
				unpaired electron. It needs another electron to be stable and steals it from your cells. Ionized water produces 
				millions of extra electrons (negative ORP), and so it is able to neutralize free-radicals and repair cell damage.<br>
				ORP: ORP refers to the negative charge that ionized water has. In other words it has a high oxidation reduction 
				potential. This negative charge gives us another benefit of the ionized water. The minerals in ionized water are 
				more bio-available because of the negative charge.

            <p>
				So many people wait till they have a disaster or get cancer (or other really serious disease) before they take the time 
				and energy to make a change! Take any illness [even a little allergy or being a little over-weight] as a sign 
				[that change is needed]. Don't wait for a disaster! <br>

				As a matter of fact I had my own near disaster. In the year before buying my first water ionizer I think I spent more 
				in doctor bills [trying to cure things the doctor ended up telling me were allergy-related] than I did on my first 
				alkaline water machine.Obviously diseases don't just pop up spontaneously. In many cases they develop over a long period 
				of time, with only a few little symptoms here and there. Any symptoms are signs that preventative change is needed. <br>

				Drinking ionized alkaline water benefits anyone.I've seen how it helped me raise my children, without allergies and free 
				of typical childhood illnesses. The list of alkaline ionized water remedies that I can personally relate to is extensive. 
				I've seen conditions such as spider veins, headaches, ear aches, throat soreness, congestion, acid re-flux, gout, 
				constipation, acne, colds, allergies, and almost "you name it", go away and stay away because of drinking ionized water.

            <p>
				Cancer starts with the acidification of cells. People tend to eat meals that are too acidic; it's really hard these 
				days not to. This makes our bodies overly acidic, which could lead to sickness and disease. Our blood will always be 
				about 7.365 pH, but the interstitial (between-cells) fluids' pH can vary, and so can the pH of cells, tissues, 
				intestines, colon and other organs. Too much acidity in the diet can lead to diseases caused by this low pH condition. 
				Read more about the benefits of ionized water for cancer and disease. <br>

				Inside our bodies, our cells, tissues and organs need varying levels of alkalinity. Even the stomach likes alkalinity 
				between meal times. A huge benefit of alkaline ionized water is that it helps to balance out the pH in the body's 
				fluids when you drink it throughout the day. Watch this very important 2-minute video and/or read the whole article

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>
				A water ionizer is an alkaline machine and an antioxidant machine. It gets hooked to your water supply and splits 
				the water clusters into two streams of water: alkaline water and acidic water. A water ionizer has two output hoses 
				for this. Alkaline water usually comes out of the top flexi-hose [spout] and is full of natural, free-hydrogen (also 
				known as molecular hydrogen, or the older term is diatomic hydrogen). Acidic water comes out the bottom hose...which 
				is usually positioned behind the water ionizer to drain into the sink. This acidic water can be collected and used for 
				cleaning purposes and as beauty water.<br>

				A water ionizer is actually quite a good water filtration device. There are a few water ionizers that offer only fair 
				filtration, but depending on the brand and model you buy, the water ionizer's filtration ranges from good to outstanding. 
				And even beyond that, water ionizers have some of the best filtration in the world (read about UltraWater filtration). 
				Our Water Ionizer Comparison page helps to clarify this.<br>

				The following video is packed with information about ionized water and very clear explanations about the benefits of 
				ionized water; including many diseases and conditions that can be helped by alkaline ionized water. It has great 
				illustrations and testimonials.

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>
				The best way to drink ionized water is when it's freshly poured, and then sip on it continuously throughout the day. 
				You need to take measures to not lose the hydrogen (to evaporation) if you can possibly do it.<br>
				Hydrogen Antioxidants get dissolved into the alkaline antioxidant water and will stably stay dissolved for several hours 
				(especially when you store it properly). But they do evaporate, so watch out for that.<br>
				Once you drink this antioxidant-rich water it circulates around to your cells fairly quickly. It been shown to last 
				(doing good) for days in the body.

				You might think owning and using a water ionizer is a luxury you can't afford, but the truth is that a water ionizer 
				is a natural tool for staying healthy and preventing diseases. A water ionizer is the most cost-effective tool for 
				keeping my family healthy I have ever owned. I actually feel that a water ionizer is worth it's weight in gold, however 
				in actual fact the cost simply breaks down to just pennies per day, when you do the math. <br>
				Disease prevention isn't something one can prove very easily, however when I compare my body's state of health now with 
				where it was headed 25 years ago, I can see and know that I have saved huge amounts on medical bills for myself and my 
				family.

				<div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>
				Actually there are occasionally people who have enough alkaline buffers and don't particularly need alkaline water. 
				However even in this case the antioxidant benefits are good. That person should simply get a hydrogen water machine instead.<br>
				Many times various family members have differing alkaline needs, so it's very convenient that water ionizers have several 
				pH-levels to choose from. Choosing the lowest level on a water ionizer, though, will not give one "medical levels" of 
				molecular hydrogen, so again, I suggest to purchase a hydrogen machine in addition or instead. Also, children under 2 years 
				old are already alkaline enough, and usually should only be given filtered water from that setting on the water ionizer.<br>
				But, anyone, from infants to old age, active or sedentary, healthy or ill, can benefit from unlimited amounts molecular
				hydrogen antioxidants, and for them a hydrogen machine is a great choice.
